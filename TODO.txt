To do:

all_winien.csv now empty after new morfeusz_freq_analysis.py - probably got mistakenly flagged by a new sanity check introduced

Can probably merge both interrogative pronoun settings
Need to decide on numerals, quantifiers categories to put in misc trainer:
- cardinals ('word' is e.g. 100, ask for polish name and 3 declensions - trzy, cztery don't have declensions in wiki data, may need to hardcode)
- ordinals ('word' is e.g. 100., ask for polish name and 3 declensions - should we include plural declensions?)
- there are also collective numerals, and quantifiers
- also complex rules around case of noun or whether noun phrase is singular/pronoun, may want to ask question here
  (not sure whether different question type or subq of above qs (with option to inc/exclude?))

Customisable keybind settings

Compeleted workflows processes:

Processed wiki entries downloaded from https://kaikki.org/dictionary/Polish/words/index.html.
http://morfeusz.sgjp.pl/en and https://github.com/kawu/concraft-pl/tree/master/bindings/python used to identify lemmas of words in sentences (with probability). 
Applied to (Web com 2018 1M) corpus of sentences (https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download) to identify word frequencies.
