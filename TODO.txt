To do:

Add back luck protection to conjugations/declensions etc.
Should find answers at same time so can skip selecting qs w/o answers
Also solves this issue: Only select singular form for nouns without plural forms
Complete for adj+noun declensions, still need for verb conjugations plus words.

Can currently deselect all cases/tenses causing error on game start

Need to add option to verbs to include/exclude impersonal forms
Also option to exclude niech imperative forms

Currently have all lemmas saved in lower case - should change this because of e.g. Polska
Add verification for verbs, adj, nouns that must have most basic conjugation/declension to add to all_pos.csv lists

Need to decide on numerals, quantifiers categories to put in misc trainer.

Customisable keybind settings
