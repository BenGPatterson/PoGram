Need to decide on numerals, quantifiers categories to put in misc trainer.

Currently have all lemmas saved in lower case - should change this because of e.g. Polska
Add verification for verbs, adj, nouns that must have most basic conjugation/declension to add to all_pos.csv lists

Need to add option to verbs to include/exclude impersonal forms
Also option to exclude niech imperative forms

Add back luck protection to conjugations/declensions etc.
Should find answers at same time so can skip selecting qs w/o answers
Also solves: Only select singular form for nouns without plural forms

Compeleted workflows processes:
