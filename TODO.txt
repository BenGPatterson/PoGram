Need to process raw wiktionary pages (script in workflows):

- remove non-lemmas to help file size
- key with name of word
- currently each sense is different entry, should have each as list under above key

Downloaded raw wiktionary entries from https://kaikki.org/dictionary/rawdata.html.
http://morfeusz.sgjp.pl/en can identify lemmas of words in sentences (with probability). 
Use this and corpus of sentences (https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download) to identify word frequencies.
