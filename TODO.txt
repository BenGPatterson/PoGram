Need to decide on numerals, quantifiers categories to put in misc trainer.

Currently have all lemmas saved in lower case - should change this because of e.g. Polska

Need to add option to verbs for impersonal forms
Also to exlude 1p/3p imperative forms

Add back luck protection to conjugations/declensions etc.

Tested verb conjugations up to present+past

Compeleted workflows processes:
