Code 'game' functions which take settings as input and play (cli) for now

Make actual menu, settings, etc. in application

Done:

http://morfeusz.sgjp.pl/en and https://github.com/kawu/concraft-pl/tree/master/bindings/python used to identify lemmas of words in sentences (with probability). 
Applied to (Web com 2018 1M) corpus of sentences (https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download) to identify word frequencies.

Made (very basic) tkinter application, and added pl char implementation in pl_chars.py. ideally will have way to change shortcuts for each char in future
