To do:

Move window back to base position when exiting game
Update all widgets when resize/change wm_state (i.e. clicking on maximise/minimise button). This should then update e.g. wrap on definition labels, padding on vertical subquestion placement (latter may be non-trivial)

Customisable keybind settings
