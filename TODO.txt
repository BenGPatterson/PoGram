To do:

Currently have all lemmas saved in lower case - should change this because of e.g. Polska
Add verification for verbs, adj, nouns that must have most basic conjugation/declension to add to all_pos.csv lists
Also redirect musić (outdated spelling) to musieć

Can probably merge both interrogative pronoun settings
Need to decide on numerals, quantifiers categories to put in misc trainer.

Customisable keybind settings

Compeleted workflows processes:

Processed wiki entries downloaded from https://kaikki.org/dictionary/Polish/words/index.html.
